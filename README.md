# Human Benchmark - A Tool for Quantifying Memory Recall
### Overview
Developed during my 3rd year of Biomedical Science at the University of Galway, the 'Human Benchmark' website is a distinctive tool designed to quantify memory recall capabilities.
It played an instrumental role in a major college group project investigating "Sex-specific changes in working memory in response to cold stress".

### Features
Human Benchmark focuses on enabling users to test and measure their memory recall capacities and obtain insightful data on memory functioning under different conditions.

### Project Background
**University Name:** University of Galway
<br>**Course:** Biomedical Science
<br>**Academic Year:** 3rd Year
<br>**Project Title:** *Sex-specific changes in working memory in response to cold stress*

### Usage
1. Navigate to [Human Benchmark Website](https://www.firoseshafin.com/HumanBenchmark/).
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to start your memory recall test.
3. Review your results and utilize the obtained data as needed.

### Acknowledgements
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my mentors, peers, and the University of Galway for their support and guidance throughout the development of this project.
